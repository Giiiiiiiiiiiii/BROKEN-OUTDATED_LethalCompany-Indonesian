# Lethal Company Indonesia Translation
## MADE BY gi_.i/Gi

This is a translation mod for Indonesians to make it easier for them to play.

It is currently a work in progress and updates will be continued.

## NOTES
Please send language suggestions or wrong languages on my discord, maybe a little suggestion will make this translation more realistic.

Sorry if there is wrong or bad language or standard words.

# CREDITS
LynxBite, from the Russian Translation team for helping me figure a few things out. Also for giving me an unborked version of the Autotranslate mod.

LudusTranslationis (benjenkinsv95) (https://github.com/benjenkinsv95/lethal-company-latin-mod/), for giving me pointer on how to develop the mod, and graciously lending his translation files so I could more easily translate the mod out.

PLEASE FEEL FREE TO USE THIS MOD AS A BASE FOR CREATING YOUR OWN TRANSLATIONS! The more languages that this game is playable in, the better! Translation mods are the only thing we have until Zeekers sets up a Translation page.
